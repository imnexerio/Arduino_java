# Arduino Communication Readme

This is a Java program that demonstrates how to establish communication with an Arduino board via a serial port. It sends commands to the Arduino and reads data from it using the RXTX library (GNU RXTX) for serial communication. You can use this code as a starting point for developing applications that interact with Arduino devices over a serial connection.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this program, make sure you have the following:

1. **Arduino Board**: You should have an Arduino board with a compatible sketch loaded onto it. The Arduino sketch should be designed to receive and respond to commands via the serial port. In the code example provided, it sends the commands "1" and "0" to control some functionality on the Arduino.

2. **Java Development Environment**: You need to have a Java development environment set up on your computer.

3. **RXTX Library**: Download and install the RXTX library, which provides Java support for serial communication. You can download the library from [here](http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download). Make sure to choose the appropriate version for your operating system.

## Usage

1. **Connect Arduino**: Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

2. **Upload Arduino Sketch**: Make sure you have uploaded the appropriate Arduino sketch that is compatible with the commands sent by this Java program. The sketch should read data from the serial port and respond accordingly. The sketch may look something like this:

   ```arduino
   void setup() {
     Serial.begin(9600); // Set the baud rate to match the Java program
   }
   
   void loop() {
     if (Serial.available() > 0) {
       char command = Serial.read();
       if (command == '1') {
         // Perform some action for '1'
       } else if (command == '0') {
         // Perform some action for '0'
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update Port Name**: In the Java program, update the `portName` variable to match the name of the serial port to which your Arduino is connected. The port name will be different depending on your operating system (e.g., "COM5" for Windows, "/dev/ttyUSB0" for Linux, "/dev/cu.usbmodem14101" for macOS).

4. **Compile and Run**: Compile and run the Java program. It will send "1" and "0" commands to the Arduino, and you can modify the Arduino sketch to respond accordingly.

5. **Monitor Serial Output**: You can monitor the communication between the Java program and the Arduino by opening the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor or a serial communication tool like CoolTerm.

6. **Customize and Expand**: You can customize this program to send different commands or receive data from the Arduino as needed for your specific project.
